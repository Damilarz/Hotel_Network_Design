# Network Design and Evaluation Project

## Overview

This project involves designing, evaluating, and documenting a network for **Bay Resort Hotels**, a prestigious hotel chain. The network design ensures efficient operations, scalability, and guest satisfaction by addressing both business and technical requirements for their Bournechurch hotel site.

Key deliverables include:
- Logical and physical network designs with efficient IP schemes.
- Network simulations using Cisco Packet Tracer for performance evaluation.
- Detailed documentation of design choices, configurations, and findings.

## Features

### Comprehensive Network Design
- Logical and physical diagrams showing network topology and device placement.
- Efficient IP addressing schemes using CIDR, VLSM, and VLANs.
- Coverage of both wired and wireless connections in public areas and guest rooms.

### Simulation Scenarios
- Two simulation scenarios using different routing protocols (e.g., static vs. dynamic routing).
- Analysis of performance metrics to evaluate network efficiency and reliability.

### Security Measures
- Implementation of WPA2/WPA3 wireless standards.
- VLANs for isolating guest and staff networks.
- Firewall configurations and port security for enhanced protection.

### Advanced Features
- Electronic key entry systems for guest rooms.
- Optional premium Wi-Fi for guest rooms.
- Integration with the hotelâ€™s e-commerce platform for online reservations and purchases.

### WAN Connectivity
- Reliable WAN connections to the nearest regional HQ and Head Office.
- Hub-and-spoke WAN network for seamless interconnectivity across hotel sites.

## Requirements
